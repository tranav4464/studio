# **App Name**: ContentCraft AI

## Core Features:

- New Blog Creation: A creation flow that accepts blog topics and desired tone/style/length as inputs, using optional reference files. The flow should provide outline customization before generating a full blog post.
- Frase-Style Blog Editor: A rich text editor for AI-written blog posts, enabling inline edits and AI-driven suggestions like 'Improve,' 'Expand', and 'Simplify'. An Optimization Panel gives SEO scores (readability, keyword density, quality) as well as gap analysis with top search results. Also it detects repetitions, vague wording, and plagiarism risks, and rewrites.
- Hero Image Generator: Automatic hero image generation (using Stability AI). It can create a few image options based on the blog title and selected tone, with visual theme application, regeneration, caption/alt text and PNG/SVG export.
- Content Repurposing: Using the main article, generate a tool for creating tweet threads, LinkedIn posts (tone-adapted), and email newsletter summaries. The generated snippets come with an edit area, 'copy to clipboard', and a 'regenerate' option.
- Export Options: Offer export options for blog posts in Markdown, HTML, and PDF formats, including image assets.
- Dashboard and Content Manager: A dashboard/content manager provides a sidebar with 'New Blog,' 'My Blogs,' and 'Settings'. List/Grid view for created blogs shows title, date, status, with edit/delete/export actions. It has autosave for drafts.
- Profile & Personalization: The user profile includes settings for default tone, blog template, and export format, with rules such as 'Use diagrams in how-to posts', and saved style presets.

- Simple, line-based icons with a modern aesthetic.
- A clean, grid-based layout to present content in a clear and organized manner.
